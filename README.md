## Hi, I'm Jirol Delos Santos

### Senior Flutter Team Lead • Mobile Developer • Software Engineer

I’m a Senior Flutter Team Lead based in Makati, with 1.5 years of experience leading mobile development at a startup. I build cross-platform apps using Flutter and Dart, following the MVC pattern and managing state with Provider and Riverpod. I’ve worked with Firebase and Supabase for backend services, and I have basic experience with Laravel, Node.js, and MongoDB for more custom solutions.

I’ve published two apps on both the App Store and Play Store, handling deployment through App Store Connect, TestFlight, and the Play Console. I use Git for version control and Figma for designing and collaborating on UI/UX. My projects often involve REST API integration, MySQL databases, and building role-based systems for ecommerce, booking platforms, and HR/payroll tools, including payment gateways like PayMongo and Stripe.

As a team lead, I oversee architecture decisions, review code, mentor junior devs, and help maintain a clean and efficient development process. Right now, I’m managing three active projects: maintaining the older version of our HR & Payroll system, leading a rebuild of the same system, and working on a personal ecommerce app to help small businesses in my community in Calamba. That personal project also helps support my family as we recover from financial setbacks from a failed business.

I’m always learning, taking online courses, exploring new tools, and staying updated with what’s new in mobile development. I’m also open to new opportunities where I can keep growing and contributing as both a developer and a team lead.
